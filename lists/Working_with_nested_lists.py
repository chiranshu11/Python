# Given the variable countries defined as:

#             Name    Capital  Populations (millions)
countries = [['China','Beijing',1350],
             ['India','Delhi',1210],
             ['Romania','Bucharest',21],
             ['United States','Washington',307]]

# code to print out the capital of India
# by accessing the list


#According to last example, created list variable but that will take memory
#so here is the simpler version

print(countries[1][1])
print(countries[1][2])
